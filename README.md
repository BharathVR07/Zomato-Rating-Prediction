# Zomato-Rating-Prediction

## Project Overview
• Created a machine learning model that predicts the ratings of the restaurants.

## How will this project help?
• This project helps the customers to check the ratings of the restaurants based on the location, cuisines and price range.

## Resources Used
• Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.

• Dataset by Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning
• Handling the missing/null values.

• Plotted bargraphs, pie charts, distplots, QQ plot and heatmap for numerical and categorical features for EDA.

## Feature Engineering
• Handling the ordinal and nominal categorical features using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding and ordinal encoding.

## Feature Selection
• Feature selection using Extra tree regressor

## Model Creation and Evaluation
Metrics : R2 score.

• Linear Regression - 90.5%

• Ridge Regresssion - 90.5%

• Lasso Regresssion - 90.5%

• Random Forest Regression - 98.5%
